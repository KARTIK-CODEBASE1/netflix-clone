# Netflix Clone

This is a simple Netflix clone built using HTML and CSS. It mimics the basic layout and design of the Netflix homepage, showcasing my skills in front-end web development. The project is a great example of how to create responsive and visually appealing layouts using only HTML and CSS.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Simple, clean design inspired by Netflixâ€™s homepage.
- Use of modern CSS techniques to build the layout (flexbox, grid, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout design, including flexbox and grid for responsiveness.
